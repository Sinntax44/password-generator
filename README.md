# password-generator
a very noob password generator made with ruby

**This is a CLI password generator**. 
It will prompt the user the length of the password they want (how many characters).
The script will randomly generate a password and also give out the entropy of the said password.

Still a work in progress...let me know any feedback to make it much better.
